# Social Network API

## Description

Social Networks have become so prevalent in modern society that they are a part of our daily lives. Whether it's for fun, work, or networking, we are constantly interacting with social networking sites. We are all clamouring to have our voices heard (as least virtually) and to react to everyone else's thoughts along the way. With this simplistic social networking API, you can do just that. You will be able to create thoughts and reactions, as well as add friends (and remove them, if you have a falling out).
